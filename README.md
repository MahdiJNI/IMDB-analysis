to understand or find some factors that may help a movie to be in IMDB Top 250 list,
and/or what makes a movie to achieve more success in ratings.

The data was collected from multiple sources, but mostly they were collected from :         imdb.com    and    boxofficemojo.com.


Data cleaning :
-------
In the sql file " imdb_dataset_exploration_cleaning.sql " i cleaned the dataset to some extent which you can see in the sql file,
but some of the cleaning codes are not included in the sql file which you can see them in the python file that is uploaded.
